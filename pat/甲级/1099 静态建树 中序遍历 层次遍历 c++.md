1099 Build A Binary Search Tree (30 分)

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Given the structure of a binary tree and a sequence of distinct integer keys, there is only one way to fill these keys into the tree so that the resulting tree satisfies the definition of a BST. You are supposed to output the level order traversal sequence of that tree. The sample is illustrated by Figure 1 and 2.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer *N* (≤100) which is the total number of nodes in the tree. The next *N* lines each contains the left and the right children of a node in the format `left_index right_index`, provided that the nodes are numbered from 0 to *N*−1, and 0 is always the root. If one child is missing, then −1 will represent the NULL child pointer. Finally *N* distinct integer keys are given in the last line.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the level order traversal sequence of that tree. All the numbers must be separated by a space, with no extra space at the end of the line.

### Sample Input:

```in
9
1 6
2 3
-1 -1
-1 4
5 -1
-1 -1
7 -1
-1 8
-1 -1
73 45 11 58 82 25 67 38 42
```

### Sample Output:

```out
58 25 82 11 38 67 45 73 42
```

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int N;

struct node{
    int data;
    int left;
    int right;
};

node n[101];
int num[101];
int cursor=0;

void buildtree(int cur){
    if(n[cur].left!=-1) buildtree(n[cur].left);
    n[cur].data = num[cursor++];
    if(n[cur].right!=-1) buildtree(n[cur].right);
}

void levelorder(){
    queue<int> Q;
    Q.push(0);
    while(Q.size()){
        auto t = Q.front();
        Q.pop();
        if(t!=0) cout<<' ';
        cout<<n[t].data;
        if(n[t].left!=-1) Q.push(n[t].left);
        if(n[t].right!=-1) Q.push(n[t].right);
    }
}

int main(){
    cin>>N;
    for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
        int j,k;
        cin>>j>>k;
        n[i].left = j;
        n[i].right = k;
    }

    for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
        cin>>num[i];
    }

    sort(num,num+N);

    buildtree(0);
    levelorder();
}
