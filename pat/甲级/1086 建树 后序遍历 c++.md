1086 Tree Traversals Again (25 分)

An inorder binary tree traversal can be implemented in a non-recursive way with a stack. For example, suppose that when a 6-node binary tree (with the keys numbered from 1 to 6) is traversed, the stack operations are: push(1); push(2); push(3); pop(); pop(); push(4); pop(); pop(); push(5); push(6); pop(); pop(). Then a unique binary tree (shown in Figure 1) can be generated from this sequence of operations. Your task is to give the postorder traversal sequence of this tree.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains a positive integer *N* (≤30) which is the total number of nodes in a tree (and hence the nodes are numbered from 1 to *N*). Then 2*N* lines follow, each describes a stack operation in the format: "Push X" where X is the index of the node being pushed onto the stack; or "Pop" meaning to pop one node from the stack.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the postorder traversal sequence of the corresponding tree in one line. A solution is guaranteed to exist. All the numbers must be separated by exactly one space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.

### Sample Input:

```in
6
Push 1
Push 2
Push 3
Pop
Pop
Push 4
Pop
Pop
Push 5
Push 6
Pop
Pop
```

### Sample Output:

```out
3 4 2 6 5 1
```

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct node{
    int val;
    node* left;
    node* right;
};

vector<int> path;

void maketree(node*&root){
    root = new node;
    int i;
    cin>>i;
    root->val = i;
    string s1;
    cin>>s1;
    if(s1=="Push"){
        maketree(root->left);
    }else{
        root->left=NULL;
    }

    s1="";
    cin>>s1;
    if(s1=="Push"){
        maketree(root->right);
    }else{
        root->right=NULL;
    }

}

void postordertraverse(node* root){
    if(root==NULL) return;
    postordertraverse(root->left);
    postordertraverse(root->right);
    path.push_back(root->val);
}

int main(){
    int N;
    cin>>N;
    node* root = NULL;
    string s;
    cin>>s;
    maketree(root);

    postordertraverse(root);

    for(int i=0;i<path.size();i++){
        if(i>0){
            cout<<" ";
        }
        cout<<path[i];
    }
    cout<<endl;
}
