1004 Counting Leaves (30 åˆ†)

A family hierarchy is usually presented by a pedigree tree. Your job is to count those family members who have no child.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 0<*N*<100, the number of nodes in a tree, and *M* (<*N*), the number of non-leaf nodes. Then *M* lines follow, each in the format:

```
ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]
```

where `ID` is a two-digit number representing a given non-leaf node, `K` is the number of its children, followed by a sequence of two-digit `ID`'s of its children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be `01`.

The input ends with *N* being 0. That case must NOT be processed.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, you are supposed to count those family members who have no child **for every seniority level** starting from the root. The numbers must be printed in a line, separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of each line.

The sample case represents a tree with only 2 nodes, where `01` is the root and `02` is its only child. Hence on the root `01` level, there is `0` leaf node; and on the next level, there is `1` leaf node. Then we should output `0 1` in a line.

### Sample Input:

```in
2 1
01 1 02
```

### Sample Output:

```out
0 1
```

            int id = sc.nextInt();
            int k = sc.nextInt();
            for(int j=0;j<k;j++){
                int id1 = sc.nextInt();

            System.out.print(num_level[i]);

    public static void dfs(int curID,int curlevel){
        if(curlevel>maxlevel){
            maxlevel = curlevel;
